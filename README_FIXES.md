# TacticAI Model Fixes and Improvements

## Summary

Successfully resolved all major issues with the TacticAI Shot Prediction and CVAE models. Both models now work correctly and can be trained.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. DataLoader Issues âœ…
- **Problem**: DataLoader was failing with `TypeError: list indices must be integers or slices, not str`
- **Root Cause**: The code was using the installed package instead of local source code changes
- **Solution**: Used `PYTHONPATH` to ensure local source code is used, and fixed data format handling in dataset classes

### 2. Model Structure Inconsistencies âœ…
- **Problem**: Shot Prediction model was returning node-level predictions `[44, 1]` instead of graph-level predictions `[2, 1]`
- **Root Cause**: GATv2Network wasn't properly performing global readout when batch parameter was provided
- **Solution**: Fixed the model forward pass to correctly use graph embeddings from the backbone

### 3. CVAE Target Shape Mismatch âœ…
- **Problem**: CVAE outputs `[2, 44]` but targets were `[44, 2]` due to incorrect collate function
- **Root Cause**: Collate function was concatenating multi-dimensional targets instead of flattening and stacking
- **Solution**: Modified collate function to properly handle multi-dimensional targets by flattening them

### 4. GPU Memory Issues âœ…
- **Problem**: CVAE training was running out of GPU memory on M3 chip
- **Root Cause**: Batch size of 32 was too large for the M3's GPU memory
- **Solution**: Reduced batch size to 4 and disabled AMP to avoid Metal Performance Shaders issues

## Model Verification

Created comprehensive test script `test_models.py` that verifies:

### Shot Prediction Model
- âœ… Data loading: 800 samples loaded successfully
- âœ… Model outputs: `[2, 1]` (2 graphs, 1 prediction each)
- âœ… Targets: `[2, 1]` (2 targets, 1 per graph)
- âœ… Shape compatibility: Perfect match

### CVAE Model
- âœ… Data loading: 800 samples loaded successfully
- âœ… Model outputs: `[2, 44]` (2 graphs, 44 features = 22 players Ã— 2 coordinates)
- âœ… Targets: `[2, 44]` (properly flattened and stacked)
- âœ… Latent variables: Mean `[2, 32]`, Log_var `[2, 32]`
- âœ… Shape compatibility: Perfect match

## Configuration Updates

### Shot Prediction (`configs/shot.yaml`)
- Batch size: 2 (appropriate for shot prediction)
- Device: auto (works with MPS)
- AMP: true (works correctly)

### CVAE (`configs/cvae.yaml`)
- Batch size: 4 (reduced from 32 for M3 memory)
- Device: cpu (to avoid Metal issues)
- AMP: false (disabled to prevent Metal conflicts)

## Key Technical Fixes

1. **GATv2Network Global Readout**: Fixed to properly return `(node_embeddings, graph_embeddings)` tuple when batch is provided
2. **Collate Function**: Enhanced to handle multi-dimensional targets by flattening them before stacking
3. **Data Format Handling**: Improved dataset classes to handle different data formats (pickle, parquet, csv)
4. **Memory Optimization**: Reduced batch sizes and disabled AMP for CVAE to work on M3 chip

## Running the Models

### Shot Prediction Training
```bash
cd /Users/ujihara/m1_ç ”ç©¶/SportsData_Competition2025_TracticAI
PYTHONPATH=/Users/ujihara/m1_ç ”ç©¶/SportsData_Competition2025_TracticAI:$PYTHONPATH python tacticai/train/train_shot.py --config configs/shot.yaml
```

### CVAE Training
```bash
cd /Users/ujihara/m1_ç ”ç©¶/SportsData_Competition2025_TracticAI
PYTHONPATH=/Users/ujihara/m1_ç ”ç©¶/SportsData_Competition2025_TracticAI:$PYTHONPATH python tacticai/train/train_cvae.py --config configs/cvae.yaml
```

### Run Tests
```bash
cd /Users/ujihara/m1_ç ”ç©¶/SportsData_Competition2025_TracticAI
python test_models.py
```

## Status

ðŸŽ‰ **All models are now working correctly and ready for training!**

- Shot Prediction: âœ… Fully functional
- CVAE: âœ… Fully functional
- Data loading: âœ… Working for both models
- Model architectures: âœ… Properly configured
